The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent.  For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` (missing 'px') will likely lead to unexpected rendering because CSS will not know how to interpret the numeric value without a unit.
